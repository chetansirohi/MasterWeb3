 # Type - CTF / Beyond the console

 ***

 The creator of this contract was careful enough to protect the sensitive areas of its storage.

Unlock this contract to beat the level.

Things that might help:

Understanding how storage works
Understanding how parameter parsing works
Understanding how casting works
Tips:

Remember that metamask is just a commodity. Use another tool if it is presenting problems. Advanced gameplay could involve using remix, or your own web3 provider.

# Solution

1. Get a new instance
2. It is observed that the _key required to unlock is a bytes16(data[2]) and the equivalent should be bytes16
3. Learning about the storage in solidity we come to a conclusion that data[2] is stored at the slot 5, to retrieve that we need -> await web3.eth.getStorageAt(contract.address,5)
4. Next the Understanding how casting works, we see that only 16bytes are required as the equivalent key -> key = data.slice(0,34) ( starting  after 0x , every 2 charecters is 1 byte)
