### Solution

* Get new Instance
* After carefully reading the smart contract we can see that there is a typo  in  function Fal1out() , which assigns the owner to the caller of the function
* Hence using remix, with injected web3 wallet (metamask) and deploying the contract at the instance's address
* Calling the Fal1out function results in the caller being assingned as the owner
