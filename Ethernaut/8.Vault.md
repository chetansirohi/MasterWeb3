## Unlock the vault to pass the level!

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Vault {
  bool public locked;
  bytes32 private password;

  constructor(bytes32 _password) {
    locked = true;
    password = _password;
  }

  function unlock(bytes32 _password) public {
    if (password == _password) {
      locked = false;
    }
  }
}
```

# Solution
1. Get a new instance
2. It is observed that the password state variable is  bytes32 private, though still marked private, we can see its value on the blockchain
3. Storage management of Ethereum -> the password is stored at slot 1, web3.eth.getStorageAt('Instance address',1)
4. Pass the obtained value to the unlock function
5. Now check the locked vraiable , it should be set to false ,thus stating that the vault is unlocked
