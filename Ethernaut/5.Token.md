# Type -CTF

# The goal of this level is for you to hack the basic token contract below.

You are given 20 tokens to start with and you will beat the level if you somehow manage to get your hands on any additional tokens. Preferably a very large amount of tokens.

Things that might help:

  - What is an odometer?

pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract Token {

  mapping(address => uint) balances;
  uint public totalSupply;

  constructor(uint _initialSupply) public {
    balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply = _initialSupply;
  }

  function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool) {
    require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
    balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balances[_to] += _value;
    return true;
  }

  function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint balance) {
    return balances[_owner];
  }
}
```

# Solution

1. Get a new instance
2. The objective is to somehow exploit the contract and increase the player's balance to greater than 20
3. It is observed that in the transfer if the _value sent is greater than 0 and 20(balance of the player), it can trigger an underflow
4. To exploit the contract, we use the transfer function
   * contract.trnasfer('any address', any value greater than player balance and greater than 0)
