# Type - CTF

***

### Usage of delegatecall is particularly risky and has been used as an attack vector on multiple historic hacks. With it, your contract is practically saying "here, -other contract- or -other library-, do whatever you want with my state". Delegates have complete access to your contract's state. The delegatecall function is a powerful feature, but a dangerous one, and must be used with extreme care.

Please refer to the The Parity Wallet Hack Explained article for an accurate explanation of how this idea was used to steal 30M USD.

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Delegate {

  address public owner;

  constructor(address _owner) {
    owner = _owner;
  }

  function pwn() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }
}

contract Delegation {

  address public owner;
  Delegate delegate;

  constructor(address _delegateAddress) {
    delegate = Delegate(_delegateAddress);
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  fallback() external {
    (bool result,) = address(delegate).delegatecall(msg.data);
    if (result) {
      this;
    }
  }
}
```

# Solution

1. Get a new instance
2. It is observed that the fallback function in the Delegation contract can be triggered to delegatecall the Delegate contract thus the code will be executed (for Delegate) in context of Delegation contract,i.e., it will use the storage of the Delegation contract.
3. The delegatecall allows the Delegation contract to execute the pwn function of the Delegate contract in its own context. This means the owner of the Delegation contract can be changed by the pwn function of the Delegate contract.
4. Deploy the Delegate contract at the instance address and deploy the delegatation contract *
