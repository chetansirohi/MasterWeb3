```
uint8 number = 255;
number++;
```
In this case, we've caused it to overflow — so number is counterintuitively now equal to 0 even though we increased it. (If you add 1 to binary 11111111, it resets back to 00000000, like a clock going from 23:59 to 00:00).

An underflow is similar, where if you subtract 1 from a uint8 that equals 0, it will now equal 255 (because uints are unsigned, and cannot be negative).

To prevent this, OpenZeppelin has created a library called SafeMath that prevents these issues by default

We've already included OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library for you in safemath.sol. You can take a quick peek at the code now if you want to, but we'll be looking at it in depth in the next chapter.

First let's tell our contract to use SafeMath. We'll do this in ZombieFactory, our very base contract — that way we can use it in any of the sub-contracts that inherit from this one.

Import safemath.sol into zombiefactory.sol.

Add the declaration using SafeMath for uint256;.

```
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

import "./ownable.sol";
// 1. Import here
import "./safemath.sol";

contract ZombieFactory is Ownable {

  // 2. Declare using safemath here
  using SafeMath for uint256;

  event NewZombie(uint zombieId, string name, uint dna);

  uint dnaDigits = 16;
  uint dnaModulus = 10 ** dnaDigits;
  uint cooldownTime = 1 days;

  struct Zombie {
    string name;
    uint dna;
    uint32 level;
    uint32 readyTime;
    uint16 winCount;
    uint16 lossCount;
  }

  Zombie[] public zombies;

  mapping (uint => address) public zombieToOwner;
  mapping (address => uint) ownerZombieCount;

  function _createZombie(string memory _name, uint _dna) internal {
    uint id = zombies.push(Zombie(_name, _dna, 1, uint32(now + cooldownTime), 0, 0)) - 1;
    zombieToOwner[id] = msg.sender;
    ownerZombieCount[msg.sender]++;
    emit NewZombie(id, _name, _dna);
  }

  function _generateRandomDna(string memory _str) private view returns (uint) {
    uint rand = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_str)));
    return rand % dnaModulus;
  }

  function createRandomZombie(string memory _name) public {
    require(ownerZombieCount[msg.sender] == 0);
    uint randDna = _generateRandomDna(_name);
    randDna = randDna - randDna % 100;
    _createZombie(_name, randDna);
  }

}

```
